## *packagedApp* (Documentation)

### Folder Purpose
This folder contains two versions of the atomTech python file. The folder labeled "appWithPort" contains the files and package using the custom MIDI port "atomCtrl" while the "appWithoutPort" folder uses the default "IAC Driver Bus 1" MIDI port. 

The application is compiled, and to the best of my knowledge, it should run properly based on how I compiled it ("pyinstaller atomTech.py --windowed" format). When I attempt to launch the program as an app, it does not launch.
