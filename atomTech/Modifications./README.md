### "Modifications." Folder
The purpose of this folder is to experiment and build upon the "atomTech.py" file, which properly converts and sends an audio input's pitch into MIDI "Note On" and "Note Off" messages. 

### Description
The folders contain updates on progress of pitch detection algorithm testing, amplitude to velocity conversion, note length accuracy, and the implementation of a pitch wheel element to make the program more accurate.

### Dependencies
This program requires the Aubio and Mido python libraries. 
	
### Acknowledgement
I have had much help from Professor Akito Van Troyer. I also have utilized the algorithms found in Aubio and Mido.
