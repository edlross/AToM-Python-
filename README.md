### Audio to MIDI Controller Project
The Audio To MIDI (ATOM) program allows musicians to convert audio from a given input into a MIDI message that can be used as a MIDI output. Proper implementation of this program will allow all musicians to naturally utilize MIDI without having to learn how to play the piano. This allows for innovation in both production and performance for musicians of any background.
